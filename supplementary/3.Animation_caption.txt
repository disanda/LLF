Animation caption:
We present interpretable face morphing results across different feature sizes through animations. The first row shows morphing effects derived from 8×8 features, corresponding to interpretable factors such as two distinct hairstyles, pose variations, and exposure changes. The second row illustrates morphing effects from 16×16 features, interpreted as changes in the mouth, nose, mouth details, and hairstyle. The third row shows morphing effects from 32×32 features, corresponding to eyebrow movement, nose variations, eyelash changes, and hair color. The last row presents morphing effects from 64×64 features, interpreted as face-boundary blur, lower-eyelid movement, eye opening/closing, and eyeball rotation.
